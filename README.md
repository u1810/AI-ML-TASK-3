# AI-ML-TASK-3
Goal: Predict house prices by applying a linear regression model on the Housing dataset.

Dataset: Used the Housing.csv ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

Process: Cleaned and prepared the data before training a linear regression model.

Model Training: Fit a linear regression model and assessed its performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

Visualization: Compared the predicted prices against the actual values using a plot

Technologies and Libraries: Used Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment with Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Scikit-learn for building the regression model, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
